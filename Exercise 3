from random import randint
n = randint(1, 100)
while True:
    i = int(input("What number from 1-100 have I chosen?: "))
    if i == n:
        print("Yeeess correct, I was thinking of {}!".format(n))
        break # if that condition is reached, the code stops
    if i < n: print("Nope, too low, guess again!")
    if i > n: print("Waaay too high, you can do better!")
